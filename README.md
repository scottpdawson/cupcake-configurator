# Emoticakes Order Form

My wife's Emoticakes business wanted a way to have customers configure an order based on pricing and options. This site lets customers put in an order date, add any number of cakes or cupcakes (in dozens) with cake flavors and frosting flavors, and send her an email with the request for a quote. Read more about the build process in my [detailed blog post](https://scottpdawson.com/building-a-custom-cake-order-form-with-react/).

## Contributing
Since this is a bespoke application for a business, pull requests are not appropriate. If you see something that should be fixed, feel free to open an issue. Additional to-do items: 

* Continue to evolve the design and interactivity.
* Refactor the code to make more reusable
* Refactor the code to use Redux instead of a single component state (allow for component reuse and additional abstraction)
