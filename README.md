# cupcake-configurator

My wife wanted a way to have customers configure a cupcake order based on pricing and options. This page lets customers put in an order date, add any number of cupcakes (in dozens) with cake flavors and frosting flavors, and send her an email with the request for a quote.

You can see the live page in production at https://emoticakes.com/order-quote, but probably best to not submit an order unless you're serious about ordering!
